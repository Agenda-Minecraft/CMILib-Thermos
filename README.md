# CMILib

## Introduction

This plugin helper, or **library**, is a handy tool that allows us to easily manage common phrases, hex colours and more. Instead of each plugin having to write its own code for these features, this library allows them to share this functionality, as well as providing an API for other developers to extend their own plugin features. 

This reduces the overall size of other plugins, and makes updating and maintaining plugins much easier and more consistent.

**NOTE:** This library is required by ALL Zrips' plugins.

## Library Updates

It's heavily recommended to always keep this library up to date. You can download the latest builds from:

## Installation Instructions

You can `/stop`, and back-up your server first,

Download the latest version of the CMILib .jar file, and drop it in the `~/plugins/` directory.

Include any Zrips plugin in the `~/plugins/` directory as well.

And then you can start the server back up.

After the first time running, if it's `Done!` and there have been no issues, you can stop and start it one more time. You can use this downtime to review plugin configurations.
