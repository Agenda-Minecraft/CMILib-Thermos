# CMILib

## Introduction

The plugin helper, or **library**, is a handy tool that helps us easily manage common phrases, hex colors, and more. Instead of each plugin having its own code for these features, the plugin helper allows multiple all the Zrips made plugins to share the same code. 

This reduces the overall size of our plugins and makes updating and maintaining these plugins a lot simpler and more consistent.

## Required Dependancy

All current versions of the Zrips made plugins require this library to operate.

## Releases / Downloads

It's recommended to always keep the CMILib .jar file up to date (as well as all Zrips plugins). You can download the latest release from these urls:

Include any Zrips plugin in the `~/plugins/` directory as well.

And then you can start the server back up.

After the first time running, if it's `Done!` and there have been no issues, you can stop and start it one more time. You can use this downtime to review plugin configurations.
